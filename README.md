## About the game
4-in-a-row is a game played on a board with 7 columns and 6 rows of slots, where two players take turns placing coloured tokens into the board. The first player to get at least 4 consecutive tokens of their colour in a row wins the game.

A four-in-a-row can be made horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, and do not wrap around the edges of the board. Tokens are dropped down a column onto the board, and can stack on top of each other. If a column has all 6 slots filled, you cannot place another token on top. The game ends if one of the players is able to make a four-in-a-row or the entire board gets filled (resulting in a stalemate).
