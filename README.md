Connect Four is a game played on a board with 7 columns and 6 rows of slots, where two players take turns placing tokens into the board. The goal is to create a series of four of your tokens in a row, with no empty slots in between them. This is also called a four-in-a-row.

A four-in-a-row can be made horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, and do not wrap around the edges of the board. Tokens are dropped down a column onto the board, and can stack on top of each other. If a column has all 6 slots filled, you cannot place another token on top. If all 7 columns on the board are filled, the game ends in a tie.
